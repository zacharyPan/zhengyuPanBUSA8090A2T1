  Only if you don't have unzip command in Ubuntu, each machine could be difference.

	sudo apt install unzip
	unzip world_x-db.zip

  To check my answer, please directly use sql file




  Go to the directory 'world_x-db'

	cd world_x-db




  My root password doesn't work!so,

	sudo mysql

  I linked the new database to same username we were always using with same password

	mysql> GRANT ALL ON world_x.* TO awkologist@localhost IDENTIFIED BY "awkology";



	mysql> create database world_x;



	mysql> exit



	mysql -u awkologist -p world_x < world_x.sql




  Finally, to check table, 
	 mysql -u awkologist -p world_x -e 'show tables;'






Question 2,b




	mysql -u awkologist -p world_x -e 'select c.Name, cl.Percentage, ct.Name from (country c inner join countrylanguage cl on c.code = cl.CountryCode and cl.Language = "English") inner join city ct on c.Capital = ct.ID  where  cl.Percentage > 50';
